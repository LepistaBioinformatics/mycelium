# Here the downstream (client) services should be configured
services:
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # The main service definition
  #
  # If must include the following fields:
  # - name: The name of the service. The name should be unique and is used to
  #         identify the service and call it from the gateway url path.
  #
  # - host: The host of the service. The host should include the port number.
  #
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - name: test-service-01
    # Required field. The host of the service. The host should include the port
    # number. It can be a single host or a vector of hosts.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    # ```yaml
    # hosts:
    #   - localhost:8083
    #   - localhost:8084
    # ```
    #
    host: localhost:8083

    # Optional. The protocol of the service.
    protocol: http

    # Optional. When true, the service will be discovered by LLM agents.
    discoverable: true

    # Optional together with discoverable field. Description should be used
    # during the service discovery by LLM agents.
    description: The service description

    # Optional together with discoverable field. The path to the openapi.json
    # file. The file should be used for external clients to discover the
    # service. Is is used for the service discovery by LLM agents.
    openapiPath: /openapi.json

    # Optional together with discoverable field. The health check configuration
    # for the service.
    healthCheckPath: /health

    # Define secrets
    #
    # The secrets are used to authenticate the api gateway at the downstream
    # service. Secrets should be defined in the following format:
    #
    # # Direct definition:
    #
    # ```yaml
    # secrets:
    # - name: test-service-01-query-token
    #   queryParameter:
    #     name: "token"
    #     token: "my-secret-token"
    #
    # - name: test-service-01-authorization-header-token
    #   authorizationHeader:
    #     name: token
    #     prefix: Bearer
    #     token: "my-secret-token"
    # ```
    #
    # Direct definition should be used only for testing purposes. In production
    # the secrets should be stored in as environment variables or vault secrets.
    #
    # # Environment variable definition:
    #
    # ```bash
    # export MY_SECRET_01='{"queryParameter": {"name": "token","token": "my-secret-01"}}'
    # export MY_SECRET_02='{"authorizationHeader": {"name": "token","prefix": "Bearer","token": "my-secret-02"}}'
    # ```
    #
    # ```yaml
    # secrets:
    # - name: test-service-01-query-token
    #   env: MY_SECRET_01
    #
    # - name: test-service-01-authorization-header-token
    #   env: MY_SECRET_02
    # ```
    #
    # The environment variable should be defined in the system where the api
    # gateway is running and should use the JSON format or YAML formats.
    #
    # # Vault secret definition:
    #
    # Not already implemented.
