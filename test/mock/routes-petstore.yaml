      This is a sample Pet Store Server based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
      You can find out more about Swagger at https://swagger.io. In the third
      iteration of the pet store, we've switched to the design first approach!
      You can now help us improve the API whether it's by making changes to the
      definition itself or to the code. That way, with time, we can improve the
      API in general, and expose some of the new features in OAS3.

    # Optional together with discoverable field. The type of the service.
