## Recent Decisions (Last 60 days)

### AD-001: Use `OnceLock<Result<Tera, String>>` instead of `lazy_static! + panic!` (2026-04-06)

**Decision:** Replace the `lazy_static!` Tera initialization (which called `panic!` on failure) with
`std::sync::OnceLock<Result<Tera, String>>`, initialized lazily and propagating errors to callers.

**Reason:** `OnceLock` is available since Rust 1.70 (already required by this crate), supports
fallible init, and avoids the `lazy_static` dependency pattern. `Tera::default()` + runtime error
was considered but rejected — it hides the init failure too silently.

**Trade-off:** Callers of the template accessor must now handle `Result`; slightly more boilerplate
at call sites.

**Impact:** All template-render call sites must propagate errors via `?` or explicit match.

### AD-002: Propagate `choose_host()` error at call sites (2026-04-06)

**Decision:** Changed `choose_host()` signature to return `Result<String, MappedErrors>` and updated
both call sites (`route.rs`, `load_operations_from_downstream_services.rs`) to use `?`.

**Reason:** The change to `service.rs` forced a signature change; updating call sites was mandatory,
not optional. Committed all 5 files together as one atomic change.

**Trade-off:** None — this was the only correct approach.

**Impact:** Any future call site adding `choose_host()` must handle the error.

## Lessons Learned

### L-001: Signature changes in domain DTOs ripple to call sites outside the feature scope (2026-04-06)

**Context:** The `fix-notifier-panics` spec listed 3 target files. Changing `choose_host()` to
return `Result` forced updates in `route.rs` and `load_operations_from_downstream_services.rs`,
which were not in the spec.

**Problem:** Spec scope was defined by panic sites, not by the full call graph of changed APIs.

**Solution:** Committed all 5 files together; spec traceability remained valid since the call-site
changes were mechanical (add `?`), not behavioral.

**Prevents:** Future specs that change a public DTO method should proactively grep call sites and
include them in scope.

## Deferred Ideas

- [ ] Audit remaining `unwrap()` calls across the full codebase (test code excluded) — Captured during: fix-notifier-panics
- [ ] Email address validation in the DTO layer (not just at send time) — Captured during: fix-notifier-panics
- [ ] Hot-reloading Tera templates (ops/config concern) — Captured during: fix-notifier-panics
